# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16

## Overview
*Background and Purpose*

Since the work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was successful, another, larger project has been assigned. Now we will be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

This project will utilize approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. One of the datasets will be chosen, and PySpark will be used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark, Pandas, or SQL will be used to determin potential bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. Then, a summary will contain the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
